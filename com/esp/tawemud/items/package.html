Contains the classes that define the items that can exist in the mud.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>Every object in the mud (apart from the world and zone objects) must exist in this class. All must eventually
inherit from the class com.esp.tawemud.items.Item as a base. From there anything is possible. Nothing is necessary
to make an object type creatable other than making the class.</p>
