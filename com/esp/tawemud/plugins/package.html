Plugins to extend the capabilities of the mud.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>Plugins are designed to integrate with the mud albeit in a reasonably basic fashion. All
plugins must implement the PluginInterface interface. Once this is done they can be loaded
into the mud and if necessary start up their own thread. Also a script action is provided
call functions on the plugin as necessary. Although it is not necessary that the plugins
exist in this package, keeping them all together would be usefull.</p>
