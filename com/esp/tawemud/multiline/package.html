Multiline input handlers.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>Normal input to the mud is through a line by line basis, each line forming a command.
The MultiLineHandler interface provides a means for making a player input a number of lines
before action is taken. Classes that implement this interface should exist in this package.</p>
