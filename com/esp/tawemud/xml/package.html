XML parsing libraries.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>Standard XML parsing libraries are available on the Java platform. Unfortunatley the standard
ones may not work as well as the non-standard ones. As such this package contains two classes,
XmlLoader and XmlWriter that everything in the mud uses to load and save xml files. In the case
where a better XML library becomes available changing these two classes is all that is necessary.</p>
